## Coding Test - Simulate a robot

- Write a program that simulates the movements of a robot. The robot can have three possible movements:

turn right
turn left
advance

- The robot is placed on a hypothetical infinite grid, facing a particular direction (north, east, south, or west) at a set of {x,y} coordinates, e.g., {3,8}, with coordinates increasing to the north and east.

- Create a Class Robot that contains a method execute which given a number of instructions will calculate the robot's new position, and the the direction in which it is pointing.

Example
The letter-string "RAALAL" means:

Turn right
Advance twice
Turn left
Advance once
Turn left yet again
Say a robot starts at {7, 3} facing north. Running this stream of instructions should leave it at {9, 4} facing west.

## Inputs and Outputs

- The argument of the execute is string in the format X Y BEARING COMMANDS. The method should return a one-liner string in the format X Y BEARING. In the example above, the execute argument would be 7 3 NORTH RAALAL, and the method should return 9 4 WEST.

## Tests
Javascript
Tests are using Jest. To run them, use the following command:

npx jest robot-simulator.spec.js
